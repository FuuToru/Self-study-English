I really like the hospitality of the people in my village where we are living close together and willing to give others a hand when needed. It's what I can hardly find in my current dwelling where neighbours see each other as strangers.

hospitality [/ˌhɒs.pɪˈtæl.ə.ti/ ]: sự hiếu khách
give someone a hand (idiom): giúp đỡ
dwelling [/ˈdwel.ɪŋ/]; chỗ ở 
stranger [/ˈstreɪn.dʒər/]; người lạ
