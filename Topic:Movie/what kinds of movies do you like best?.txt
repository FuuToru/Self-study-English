To be honest, I'm quite easy-going when it comes to movies. I can watch any genre of movie as long as they don't involve too many violent scenes. But if I had to pick only one type of movie I like best, I would have to say comedy. Mainly because watching comedy movies always lifts my spirits, especially after a stressful day of study.
